## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://scs.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://gatech.edu), advised by [Prof. Steve Mussmann](https://steve.mussmann.us). I received my bachelor's degree from Turing Class at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english), an honors program jointly cultivated by [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen) and [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn). I am interested in how machine learning models can effectively and efficiently learn from limited labeled data in an explainable way. During my first year, I worked on temporal evolution with large language models that can adaptively learn from both labeled and unlabeled new knowledge over time while preserving useful information in old knowledge. Before that, I worked on several research projects related to federated learning, including its heterogeneity, reliability, security, accessibility, effectiveness, and privacy. I also participated in various projects related to visual analytics, including machine learning diagnosis and sports data analysis.
